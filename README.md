# Airplane-crashes-Data-visualization

ðŸŒ±Hey y'all! Here's a visualization on the [Airplane crashes dataset](https://github.com/Siddhi-Takawade/Airplane-crashes-Data-visualization/blob/main/Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv) since 1908 till 2009. Have a look for some weird and interesting insightsðŸ“ˆ

Visualizations created here are in accordance to the following keys : 
- Crashes by year
- Yearly Fatalities
- Total accidents by types of flight
- Yearly Military vs Passenger flight crashes
- Total count by Operator
- Total Fatalities by Operator
- Total crashes vs Fatalities vs Aboard Passengers
- Count of Accidents - Monthly, Weekly and Hourly
- WordCloud for Crash Locations
- WordCloud for Crash Descriptions
- Total number of people involved in a year


The (Yearly Fatalities, Total accidents by types of flight, Yearly Military vs Passenger flight crashes) keys contain interesting interactive plots, snippets of which are attached to this repository under [Data](https://github.com/Siddhi-Takawade/Airplane-crashes-Data-visualization/tree/main/Data) folder. To experience interacting with these plots, [view in notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19tI4Md2NdGyfTNqvX6sTX-8fUJGWcd7A?usp=sharing)
